# Variables

```
SIMPLY, VARIABLES ARE NAMES AND IN THAT WE CAN STORE NAMES, VALUES, NUMBERS ETC.
THEY GIVE THE CLARITY OF WHAT TYPE OF VALUE IS ASSIGNED TO IT. IF WE ARE STORING NUMBERS THEN WE CAN GIVE VARIABLE NAME AS numbers.
IF WE ARE STORING SOME NUMBERS LIKE 18 THEN WE CAN GIVE IT A VARIABLE NAME AS age OR JUST A SPECIFIC NAME, MEANS THEY DEFINE THE CONTEXT.


>>>phrase = "Hi, I am a boy"   HERE = IS A ASSIGNMENT OPERATOR.     
>>>print(phrase)
      
Hi, I am a boy
HERE WE SAW THAT FIRST WE CREATED A VARIABLE NAME phrase AND STORED STRINGS THERE. THEN WE INPUT IT IN PRINT FUNCTION. WE CAN ALSO USE ANOTHER METHOD WITHOUT USING PRINT.

IF WE JUST WRITE phrase THEN IT RETURNS:
phrase
      
'Hi, I am a boy'
THIS IS A STRING LITERAL.

```

```
BASIC PRACTICE QUESTIONS:

1. Using the interactive window, display some text on the screen by using the print() function.

>>>print("My name is Aaditya. I am 18 years old")

My name is Aaditya. I am 18 years old.

2. Using the interactive window, display a string of text by saving the string to a variable, then reference the string in a print() function using the variable name.


>>>name = "Aditya Jain"
      
>>>student_name = "Vinay Jain"
      
>>>print(name)
      
Aditya Jain
>>>print(student_name)
      
Vinay Jain
