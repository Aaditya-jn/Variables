# Variables

```
SIMPLY, VARIABLES ARE NAMES AND IN THAT WE CAN STORE NAMES, VALUES, NUMBERS ETC.
THEY GIVE THE CLARITY OF WHAT TYPE OF VALUE IS ASSIGNED TO IT. IF WE ARE STORING NUMBERS THEN WE CAN GIVE VARIABLE NAME AS numbers.
IF WE ARE STORING SOME NUMBERS LIKE 18 THEN WE CAN GIVE IT A VARIABLE NAME AS age OR JUST A SPECIFIC NAME, MEANS THEY DEFINE THE CONTEXT.


>>>phrase = "Hi, I am a boy"   HERE = IS A ASSIGNMENT OPERATOR.     
>>>print(phrase)
      
Hi, I am a boy
HERE WE SAW THAT FIRST WE CREATED A VARIABLE NAME phrase AND STORED STRINGS THERE. THEN WE INPUT IT IN PRINT FUNCTION. WE CAN ALSO USE ANOTHER METHOD WITHOUT USING PRINT.

IF WE JUST WRITE phrase THEN IT RETURNS:
phrase
      
'Hi, I am a boy'
THIS IS A STRING LITERAL. INDICATING THAT THE WORD OR CHARACTERS WE ENTERED, IS A STRING. PYTHON SHOWS IT BY SINGLE QUOTATION MARKS. WHEREAS IF WE TYPE print(phrase) THE OUTPUT DOES NOT HAVE
ANY QUOTATION MARKS. PYTHON UNDERSTANDS IT EARLIER WHEN WE USED DOUBLE QUOTATION MARKS WHEN ASSIGNING A VARAIBLE NAME ITS VALUE. IN SHORT WE ARE TELLING PYTHON TO INSPECT THE VRIABLE pharse.
The key takeaway here is that print() displays a readable representa-tion of a variableâ€™s value, while inspection provides additional infor-mation about the type of the value.
You can inspect other variables in python shell. Check out what happens when you type print and hit ente. WE WILL GET SOMETHING OUTPUT LIKE THIS:  <built-in function print>

BASIC PRACTICE QUESTIONS:

1. Using the interactive window, display some text on the screen by using the print() function.

>>>print("My name is Aaditya. I am 18 years old")

My name is Aaditya. I am 18 years old.

2. Using the interactive window, display a string of text by saving the string to a variable, then reference the string in a print() function using the variable name.


>>>name = "Aditya Jain"
      
>>>student_name = "Vinay Jain"
      
>>>print(name)
      
Aditya Jain
>>>print(student_name)
      
Vinay Jain
